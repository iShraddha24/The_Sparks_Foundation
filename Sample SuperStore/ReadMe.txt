Find out weak areas where you can work to make more profit:

After performing EDA on the dataset, here are some insights that can work:-
Focus on high-profit categories: Analyze the profit margins for each product category. Categories like Furniture and Technology tend to have higher profit margins compared to Office Supplies. Consider expanding your offerings in these more profitable categories.

Optimize discounts: Examine the relationship between discounts and profit. High discounts, especially on low-margin products, can significantly impact profitability. Consider adjusting your discount strategy to maximize profits while maintaining competitiveness.

Identify underperforming regions: Analyze the profit generated by each region. The South and Central regions have lower average profits compared to the West and East. Investigate the reasons behind the lower profitability in these regions and develop targeted strategies to improve performance.

Segment customers effectively: Analyze the profit generated by each customer segment. The Home Office and Corporate segments tend to have lower profit margins compared to Consumers. Consider offering tailored products and services to these segments to improve profitability.

Optimize shipping costs: Examine the relationship between shipping costs and profit. Standard Class shipping tends to have higher profit margins compared to First and Second Class. Encourage customers to choose Standard Class shipping when possible to maximize profits.


what all business problems can you derive by exploring the data?
