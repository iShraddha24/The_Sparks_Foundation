#Q1 - As a security/defense analyst, try to find out hot zone of terrorism.
From the above data, the "hot zone" of terrorism can be identified as the Middle East & North Africa (MENA) region. This conclusion is based on the highest success rate of terrorist incidents reported in this region (44,172 incidents), followed by South Asia (38,942 incidents). The presence of active and prolific terrorist groups such as the Taliban and ISIL, predominantly operating in these regions, further supports this conclusion.

Reasoning:
Geographical Concentration: The high number of incidents in the MENA region highlights it as a focal point for terrorist activities.
Group Activity: The Taliban and ISIL are among the most deadly and active terrorist groups, primarily operating in Afghanistan, Iraq, and surrounding areas, all part of the MENA region.
Historical Trends: The temporal analysis of total attacks by year shows consistent high activity in these regions, reinforcing the idea of these areas being persistent hot zones.
